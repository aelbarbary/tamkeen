                  So people started discussing the trees of the country side. ‘Abdullaah ibn ‘Umar said:

                  “I thought to myself that it was the date palm tree, but I was shy [and did not speak up].”

                  So they asked the Messenger – صَلَّى اللَّه عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ: “Tell us what it is O Messenger of Allah.”
                  He said: “It is the date palm tree.” The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)</p>

                  <p>
                    This beautiful saying of the prophet inspired us to design our logo as well as defining our strategy. At TAMKEEN, we believe that there are five important qualities a Muslim should strive to attain.

More specifically, the team leader' responsibility is (1) to monitor the attendance and participation of team members, (2) to advise and correct the behavior within the team (3) to improve communication among team members, (4) to facilitate communication across teams, and (5) to transfer leadership skills to other members.</p>
